Manon was first revealed as a playable character in Street Fighter 6 on September 16, 2022, when the game's full launch roster was announced. Her gameplay trailer was released on December 8, 2022, during The Game Awards 2022. She debuted alongside newcomers JP and Marisa, as well as legacy fighter Dee Jay in Street Fighter 6's pre-order trailer.

This ballerina / judoka / super model is a brand new contender in the world of Street Fighter made specifically for Street Fighter 6's playable roster. She joins Luke, Jamie, Kimberly, JP, Lily, and Marisa as the newcomers in this title.

Manon is a tall, thin, and lanky combatant with long limbs primed for fighting in the streets. She has short, pink hair with two longer strands of hair hanging down from the front, a blue bodysuit with slits exposing her hips and shoulders, and a white gi over top of it.

This new world warrior is described as an idealist, forever striving for self-improvement in the pursuit of beauty. She fights in hopes of becoming the strongest model in the world.

France's latest representative in Street Fighter uses a combination of her ballet and judo skills to gracefully put a hurt on her foes. With her long limbs, she slides at, leaps, and grapples anyone who stands in her way.

Manon's standout trait is her "Medal" system, which allows her to power up her command throw moves during battle. Whenever she lands one of her two main command throw special moves, her medal will increase by one level (with a maximum of five) and increase the damage of her command grabs with level five bringing about incredible strength and damage.

Additionally, Manon has a unique trait where certain target combos she performs will create a vacuum effect and bring the opponent closer to her. Though they're unsafe on block, these target combos leave Manon at an advantage on hit, putting the opponent right in front of her and making them susceptible to a devastating mix up.
